Hello, my name is Brett Raible. I am a computer science major at Grand Valley State University with no minor. 
My strongest programming language is Java, and the OS I normally use is Windows (7, 8, 10).
However, I am currently in the process of learning how to use Linux and the C language.
If you can ever find me not studying or doing homework, I will usually be in my room playing video games.
