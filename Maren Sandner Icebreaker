Hello! My name is Maren Sandner, I’m 19 and currently studying „Applied Computer Science“ as bachelor at the „Hochschule Hannover“ and aspire to study the master afterwards. 
My biggest strength is coding in Java. I also know basics of C and C++ but I still have to (and want to) learn a lot to use them efficiently. 
I enjoy working on software and computer graphic projects but have my problems with low-level-languages like Assembler. 
I spend a lot of my time studying but when I’m free I regularly go to the gym and like to play videogames or watch movies/shows.
